# Pulumi CDK Importer Tool Plugin

Assists migrating CDK-managed infrastructure to [pulumi-cdk](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-cdk).

> [!CAUTION]
> This is currently an **experimental** tool. It may not be able to migrate all CDK stacks and may have undocumented behaviors and/or bugs.
> Users should carefully test the behavior before using on production stacks.

## Installation

``` shell
pulumi plugin install tool cdk-importer
```

## Usage

``` shell
‚ùØ pulumi plugin run cdk-importer -- --help

To migrate your existing CDK infrastructure to `pulumi-cdk`:

1. Follow instructions in the [pulumi/pulumi-cdk](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-cdk) repo to embed your CDK stacks in a Pulumi program

1. Instead of running `pulumi up`, run `pulumi plugin run cdk-importer -- -stack $CFStackName`. This will import the state of the 
  infrastructure defined by your SDK stack into Pulumi state. This operation is read-only and should not modify any resources.

1. To verify that everything worked as expected, run `pulumi preview`. It should show no changes.
